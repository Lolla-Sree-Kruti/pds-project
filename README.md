# Submission Report
##### By- Pranjal Rout, Sree Kruti

## Motivation:-
We have prepared 3 projects, namely the Sorting Visualizer, a code to find roots of quadratic or linear equations, and a code to calculate the derivative of a given polynomial. We chose these sets of projects because writing the logic for the visualizer seemed interesting, and Mathematics is interesting on its own. We wanted to challenge ourselves to come out of our comfort zone and try a variety of different subjects. We have furthered our knowledge of C Programming with these projects.

## Important Highlights:-
  1) Sorting Visualizer: The code uses the concepts of functions, libraries, for loops, and arrays. The unique library       <unistd.h> is the heart and soul of this code, as it shows the sorting of the array with some delay (0.2 seconds). It is a good insight into how quickly the computer really sorts the given array.

2)   Roots of Quadratic/Linear Equation: The code uses the concepts of functions, libraries, if-else if statements and a do-while loop. The use of the library <math.h> enables us to use functions like pow() and sqrt(). Using a do-while loop, we ask the user whether they wish to continue solving equations or if they wish to exit the console. It provides the roots in the “double” data-type to the user. 

3)   Derivative Calculator: Like the previous code, this too uses the concepts of functions along with for loops and strings. It prints out the function's derivative and asks the user if they wish to calculate the derivative at some point.
## Learnings and Areas of Improvement:-
Being new to C Programming, it was difficult to convert our logic into snippets of code. We learnt how to properly implement prompts to the user (through the use of do-while loops), and also furthered our understanding of for loops, if-else statements, and the various libraries of C. We learnt about format specifiers for specific data-types. We learnt how to write and call multiple functions in the main() function. We were able to deepen our understanding of the control statements for while and for loops. In the Sorting Visualizer, we had to learn about the header file <unistd.h> and its various functions, as well as the Insertion Sorting algorithm.

If we had more experience, we could have explored the Derivative Calculator a bit more, making the calculator calculate the derivative of any given function and not just a polynomial.  For the Quadratic/Linear Equations solver, we could have tried to expand from quadratic to nth-degree polynomials as well. We could have perhaps tried to make our code a little more precise, to save memory. For the sorting visualizer we could have extended it to other sorting algorithms as well.

## Future Scope:-
1) The Sorting Visualizer can broaden the scope of teaching sorting algorithms.
2) The Quadratic/Linear Equations solver can be extended to finding roots of higher degree polynomials (reducible to Quadratic/Linear equations).
3) The Derivative Calculator as I have mentioned before can be extended to help calculate the derivative of a given function and its value at some point.

## Declaration:-
1) Lolla Sree Kruti made the code for the Sorting Visualizer;
2) Pranjal Rout made the code for the Quadratic/Linear Equation Solver;
3) Idea for Derivative Calculator was formulated by Pranjal Rout and both the members contributed equally to the code.
